# pickit

`pickit` is a small command-line tool that provides a Text-based User Interface (TUI) for interactively managing `git sparse-checkout` in `cone` mode.

It allows you to visually browse the directory structure of a repository and select which directories to include in your sparse checkout set.

## Usage

You can run the application against the repository in the current directory:

```bash
cargo run
```

Or, you can provide a path to a specific repository:

```bash
cargo run -- /path/to/your/repo
```
